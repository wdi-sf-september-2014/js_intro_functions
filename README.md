##JS Function Lab 1

Forget how old you are? Calculate it.
- Write a function called calculateAge that:
	- Takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year
	- Calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years
	- Outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
- Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
